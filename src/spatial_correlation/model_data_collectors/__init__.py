# package containing modeules for generating data to train DNNs.
# 1) Data will be generated for DNNs taking single cropped image as input and giving person bounding boxes and
# 2) also for DNNs taking multiple images (common spatial area between multiple collaborating cameras) as input
# and giving bounding boxes
